**Banking Application**<br>
	This final year project is a banking application for multiple devices based on the current trends in the Finance-Technoloy sector.<br>

	We have chosen this type of application as it offers a steep learning curve suitable for a level 8 final year project, utilising many different frameworks and
	programming languages. Since this kind of application has to offer a high degree of security we have felt like it would be a interesting topic to pursue. <br>

###Technology Overview ###<br>


	The application will be created using the Ionic Framework which supports the usage in a browser as well as Android and IOS.


	We are creating a banking application for the mobile.
	We wil be using Ionic as a front end UI as well as porting to Android and IOS.
	Node.js and Javascript will be used for the calculations/software layer.
	The software layer will make calls to the database through PHP.
	A MongoDB database will be used for storing data and will be based on a Heroku server.
