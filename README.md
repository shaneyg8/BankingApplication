	We wil be using Ionic as a front end UI as well as porting to Android and IOS.
	Node.js and Javascript will be used for the calculations/software layer.
	The software layer will make calls to the database through PHP.
	A MongoDB database will be used for storing data and will be based on a Heroku server.
