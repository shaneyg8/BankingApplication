Banking Application <br>
===================
This final year project is a banking application for multiple devices based on the current trends in the Finance-Technoloy sector.<br>
We have chosen this type of application as it offers a steep learning curve suitable for a level 8 final year project, utilising many different frameworks and
programming languages.<br> Since this kind of application has to offer a high degree of security we have felt like it would be a interesting topic to pursue. <br>
